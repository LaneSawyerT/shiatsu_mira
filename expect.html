							<p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;A Shiatsu session will last 1 hour. While the
								consultation session
								will last 1 hour and 30 minutes. The session is given fully clothed. Please wear loose
								clothing and have arms and legs fully covered, e.g. a tracksuit and long-sleeved t-shirt
								and socks. The treatment will be given on a futon, a plinth, or a chair depending on the
								type of treatment needed.</p>
							<br>
							<p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;
								Generally, the whole body is worked with a constant gradual and steady pressure applied
								with the hands, knees, elbows along the energy pathways in order to stimulate the
								correct flow of energy within the body. The treatment can include stretches, rotations
								and mere holding. After a Shiatsu treatment do not engage in strenuous activities in
								order for the work of the session to be fully assimilated. Drink plenty of water. Take
								note of the response of your body. The frequency of sessions will depend on what you
								want to achieve and is up to the individual.

								<em>&emsp;&emsp;“A few years ago, I started to develop symptoms of severe headaches, my GP prescribed
								medication with many dangerous side effects, so I decided to take the expensive route,
								but what I believed the only option for the sake of my health and see a top neurologist,
								in a private hospital. Disappointingly, he was also unable to provide any relief.
								After hearing about Shiatsu, I decided that I would try this different approach, hoping
								at least to get some temporary relief.<br />
								&emsp;&emsp;The relief Shiatsu gave was lifechanging. I don’t need to use pain killers or any other
								type of medication. I am happier and healthier.”</em>

&emsp;&emsp;Shiatsuwithmira helped me to do my job and thanks to it, I was able to finish my studies and regain my full energies.
